# Tic-Tac-Toe

A simple command-line Tic-Tac-Toe game written in Python.

## Getting Started

### Requirements

- Python 3.7+

### Running the game

```bash
python -m src.tic_tac_toe
```

### Playing

Follow the prompts to make moves. The board positions are numbered 1 through 9:
```
1 | 2 | 3
---------
4 | 5 | 6
---------
7 | 8 | 9
```

### Game Modes

You can play either human vs human or human vs a computer bot. When playing against the bot you'll be asked to choose a skill level:

- **Beginner** – picks moves at random.
- **Intermediate** – tries to win in one move or block you, otherwise plays randomly.
- **Expert** – uses the minimax algorithm for an optimal strategy.

You can also choose whether you or the bot goes first.
